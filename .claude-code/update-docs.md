# Update Documentation Slash Command

This slash command automatically updates all README, documentation, and CLAUDE.md files based on recent code changes.

## Instructions

1. First, analyze recent changes in the codebase by checking:
   - Modified files using `git status` and `git diff`
   - New files that have been added
   - Deleted files that have been removed
   - Changed functionality or features

2. Update the CLAUDE.md file to reflect:
   - Any new development commands or scripts
   - Architecture changes (new models, routes, controllers)
   - Updated file structures
   - New environment variables
   - Changed authentication flows or business logic
   - Important development notes

3. Update README.md (if it exists) with:
   - Installation or setup changes
   - New features or functionality
   - Updated usage instructions
   - Changed dependencies

4. Update any other documentation files (*.md) found in the project:
   - API documentation
   - Developer guides
   - Configuration guides
   - Any other relevant docs

5. For each file update:
   - Read the current content first
   - Preserve existing structure and formatting
   - Only update sections that need changes based on code modifications
   - Add new sections if needed for new features
   - Keep the tone consistent with existing documentation

6. After updates, provide a summary of:
   - Which files were updated
   - What changes were made
   - Any documentation that might still need manual review

Remember to:
- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on accuracy over assumptions
- Highlight any breaking changes
- Update examples if code syntax has changed
